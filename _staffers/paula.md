Hi everyone! My name is Paula and I am a rising senior studying Public Health and minoring in Data Science. I am passionate about the many applications of data science for advancing healthcare equity and about harm reduction education and accessibility. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking with friends, and hiking around the Bay. Feel free to reach out about any questions you may have with Datahub or anything else. Looking forward to working with everyone this semester!
