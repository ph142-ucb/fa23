My name is Hemakshat Sharma. I am an incoming 4+1 MPH student in Epidemiology. In my undergrad program, I took MCB and Public Health. I aim to apply a health equity framework to analyze facets of medicine. In my spare time, I enjoy playing volleyball and basketball so you will probably see me at RSF. I look forward to meeting you all!
