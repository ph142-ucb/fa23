My name is Julia I am a first year student in MPH- Maternal, Child, Adolescent Health. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May with a B.A. in Public Health and a B.S. in Molecular Environmental Biology. My research includes looking at the impact of environmental racism on poor maternal and infant health outcomes, and the role of physician decisions in maternal morbidity and mortality. In my free time I love to cook, watch reality TV, and hang out with friends. 

Also fluent in: Portuguese
