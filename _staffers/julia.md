Hello! My name is Julia I am a first year student in MPH- Maternal, Child, Adolescent Health. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May with a B.A. in Public Health and a B.S. in Molecular Environmental Biology. My research include looking at the impact of environmental racism on poor maternal and infant health outcomes, and the role of physician decisions in contributing towards maternal morbidity and mortality. I am Brazilian-American, so speak Portuguese and English, and am excited to work with you all this summer!
