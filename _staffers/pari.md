Hi everyone! My name is Pari and I am currently a 4+1 MPH Epidemiology/Biostatistics hoping to pursue a career in medicine in the future. I am passionate about health equity, and hope to explore the intersection of design, technology, and health to make medical services more accessible. During my Masters program, I look forward to continuing patient-facing research and developing skills for data collection and analysis. In my free time, you can find me watching sunsets and trying new local restaurants."
