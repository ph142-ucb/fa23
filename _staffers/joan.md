My name is Joan, and I am a second-year MPH student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. My current research interests are in social epidemiology and adolescent health, but I have also worked in a genetic epidemiology and genomics lab for the past year. Outside of class, I enjoy watching movies and exploring new food places with friends.
