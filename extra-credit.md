<!-- ## Extra Credit - Compelling Study

One of the skills we hope that you develop during this course is the ability to assess scientific information with
a critical eye. We particularly hope that you will be able to apply this skill to assessing information that is
relevant to decisions you or people you care about.

If you would like to recover points lost on the first or second midterm you have the option of an extra credit
assignment. To recover up to 3 marks on the midterm, reinforce your understanding, and to show your
creativity, you can make a short explanation of a concept from the course that includes sample question and
solution guide corresponding to topics covered during that lecture.

## Extra Credit - Statistics is Everywhere

Throughout the term, we have (and will continue to) include a recurring “Statistics is Everywhere” segment,
highlighting statistical content you may see in news, social media, or other places. The goal is to demonstrate
the relevance of statistics to the world around us. One of the skills we hope you will develop is an ability to
think critically about the quality of statistical information and about how it is presented in popular (nonscientific)
media. We hope that through this course we can equip you to be more discerning consumers of
statistical information, and to share your critical thinking with others.

For this extra credit assignment, we are asking you to provide your own “Statistics is Everywhere” example
and demonstrate this kind of critical thinking
